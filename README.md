# IPUT_SD2_RPS
Rock-Paper-Scissors Strategies Repository
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for simulating the Rock-Paper-Scissors game with various strategies. Each script defines a unique strategy for the game, and the notebooks are used to pit these strategies against each other in simulated matches.

Files Description
rsp_agent0.py: Defines the base agent for the RPS game, with methods for randomly selecting moves and maintaining game state.

rsp_strategy0.py to rsp_strategy6.py: Each file implements a different RPS playing strategy, ranging from random selection to complex statistical analysis based on past moves.

rsp_vs_group.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook to simulate group matches between different RPS strategies, compute scores, and determine the effectiveness of each strategy.

rsp_vs_single.ipynb: Similar to rsp_vs_group.ipynb, but focuses on one-on-one matches between individual RPS agents.

## How to Use
To use the repository, clone it to your local machine. You can run the Jupyter notebooks to simulate matches and observe how different strategies perform against each other in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
